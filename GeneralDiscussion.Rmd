# Summary

Working memory and selective attention were historically regarded as distinct congitive constructs reflecting the operation of distinct neural processes. Research has since established not only that there is significant interaction between these two constructs, but that there appears to be significant overlap in their function and operation. The experiments reported in this thesis have useed EEG components to investigate the relationship between attention and working memory. Specifically these experiments sought to clarify the attentional mechanisms involved in the short term storage of visual information in the face of increased load and distraction. 

In \textit{Study One} we carried out a systematic analysis on the effects of distractor presence on performance in a change detection task. The change detection task is an increasingly popular paradigm for studying working memory, and measuring individual working memory capacity. While some uses of the change detection paradigm have included irrelevant objects during encoding and retrieval stages, we lacked a detailed understanding of the effect of distraction in this task. First, we showed that even when distractor number is fixed for the entire block and distractor presence is perfectly predictable, distractors presented during encoding and retrieval lead to impaired performance on the task. This effect appears to scale, to some degree, with the number of distractors in the block. Signal detection measures reveal that this is a result of decreased sensitivity to change, rather than a differences in participants' response bias. Our results also demonstrated that the block context has additional effects on behavioural performance. When distractor number changed on a trial-by-trial basis such that it always matched the number of targets, performance on the easiest trials gets slightly worse, and performance on the hardest trials gets slightly better than equivalent trials from blocks wher distractor number was fixed.

The second aspect of \textit{Study One} involved examining the effect of individual working memory capacity on the distractor effects described above. Working memory capacity is related to improved performance on the task in all contexts however there was no relationship between filtering ability and capacity in blocks where distractor number is fixed. Working memory capacity however does appear to be predictive of an individual's ability to deal with the processing constraints that are unique to blocks where distractor number is varied and unpredictable on a trial-by-trial basis. These results suggest that the relationship between working memory caacity and distraction is more limited than previously suggested and appears to be related specifically to improved ability to flexibly adapt resources in an unpredictable context. In summary, \textit{Study One} detailed the circumstances in which distractors impair working memory performance, but also confirmed two robust effects in the change detection task. First that working memory resources are negatively impacted by increased working memory load, and secondly, that working memory resources are negatively impacted by distractor presence. In the subsequent experiments, we sought to specify the attentional mechanisms related to these two effects using EEG indices of attentional control.

\textit{Studies Two} and \textit{Three} made use of a set of lateralised ERP components in order to provide dissociable measures of attentional mechanisms which are difficult to tease apart using conventional approaches. The first of these is the N2pc component, defined as an increased negative voltage at posterior electrodes contralateral to an attended stimulus. Accumulating evidence suggests that the N2pc indexes the shift of visual attention onto an attended object [@dellacqua_spatial_2006;@hickey_electrophysiological_2006;@luck_spatial_1994]. N2pc amplitude has also been used as a measure of attentional capture by relevant stimuli [@kiss_attentional_2008], or pop-out objects [@eimer_attentional_2007;@holguin_n2pc_2009]. The second identified lateralized ERP component is an enhanced positivity contralateral to distracting or irrelevant objects [@hickey_electrophysiological_2009;@hilimire_competitive_2009;@toffanin_p4pc:_2011], referred to as Ptc. Findings from research by @hilimire_target_2012 suggest that the component reflects distractor suppression during the disambiguation of target features. However, evidence that Ptc can be elicited by target objects suggests that it may more generally reflect attentional disengagement from an attended stimulus [@burra_distractor_2014;@hilimire_event-related_2014;@sawaki_common_2012]. The final lateralized component relevant to attentional control during visual search is a sustained lateralized negativity associated with short term maintenance of task relevant features [@jolicoeur_attentional_2006;@mazza_attentional_2007;@kiss_n2pc_2008;@jolicoeur_dissociation_2008]. By recordin gthese components in the delay period of a change detection task, we hoped to elucidate which of these processes, if any, might be effected by working memory load and filtering.

In \textit{Study Two}, we used a dual task paradigm in order to manipulate working memory load while participants carried out a visual search task. Participants encoded either one or two of the objects displayed on screen, and EEG was used to measure the N2pc, Ptc, and SPCN components elicited by the visual search displays. Our results showed that the lateralized response to distractcors was effected by increased working memory load, and specifically the distractor Ptc appeared to be attenuated. This indicates that increased working memory load impacts on an individual's ability to disengage from irrelevant distractors in the visual search dispplay. The results also showed that the lateralised neural response to objects during visual search was correlated with performance on the task. Under low load, increased laterlised positivity was correlated with faster response times on both the visual search and working memory portions of the task, while under high load increased target negativity was associated with higher visual search accuracy. Taken together, the results of \textit{Study Two} suggest that increased working memory load specifically impedes distractor disengagement, while individual differences in performance on the task are correlated with improved target selection, reduced distractor capture, and more efficient object disengagement.

In \textit{Study Three}, we used a dual task paradigm in order to follow up the effect of working memory distractors on behavioural performance. Participants again performed a dual working memory a selective attention task where N2pc, Ptc, and SPCN could be measured separately for targets and distractors. Throughout the task, participants would encode only one working memory item, but half of the time this item was shown in the presence of a working memory distractor. The behavioural evidence showed that the presence of a working memory distractor results in behavioural impairments to the concurrent visual search that are similar to those observed under increased working memory load. Lateralised ERP components reveal that target processing is modulated by the presence of the working memory distractor while distractor processing appears unaffected. The fact that N2pc was lager in the condition where behavioural performance was impaired is somewhat sounterintuitive, however we also did not observe any relationships between behaviour and lateralised neural response suggesting that larger N2pc amplitude need not be assumed to index better performance. Taken together, the results of \textit{Study Three} show that working memory distractors impact negatively on visual search performance and modulate target processing, however the effect appears to be complex and specifying the mechanism involved will rely on clarifying the function of the N2pc.

# Specifying the relationship between attention and working memory

Consensus is building in favour of the general view that there is substantial funcitonal overlap between working memory and selective attention. Research is now attempting to specify the attentional processes that are related to working memory performance both in terms of within-subject effects of inceased working memory load, and between-subject effects of working memory capacity. Optimal performance of selective attention relies on several underlying processes including target identification and selection, proactive suppression of possible distractors, and efficient disengagement from irrelevant distractors that capture attention [@carrasco_visual_2011]. Evidence for the effects of low working memory availability on attentional interference is equivocal, and interference with any one of these processes would produce impaired behavioral performance associated with low working memory availability. Some evidence has been used to suggest that working memory availability engages processes involved in attending to targets, while other work has claimed that working memory is relate dto either distractor capture, or distractor disengagement. Our results suport the view that within-subject manipulations of working memory load lead to impairments of distractor disengagement, however in most other respects the interaction is more complex.

Previous work has often used within-subject effects of load, and between-subject differences in performance as alternate ways of measuring the same phenomenon however our results question this approach. @heitz_focusing_2007 for example used a between-subject approach and concluded that working memory capacity affects the speed of attentional deployment to targets, whereas @mcnab_prefrontal_2008 used a within subject approach in order to show that 

Individual differeneces from study two suggest that mechanisms underlying within-subject effects may be different from mechanisms underlying between-subject effects. Some people have shown they're very similar in terms of behavioural interactions, and use of terms like working memory availabiltiy to collapse across but our data suggest this may be premature and that qualitatively different mechanisms underlie the interacions between, capacity and attention and load and attention.

Working memory distractors don't just get unnecessarily stored, have distinct impact on attention which is understudied. Increased oad and presence of working memory distractors have similar effect on performance, and while vogel have suggested that distractors are unnecessarily stored by low capacity peopole, our data suggestst tahat oad and WM distractors have distnct effects on attentional processing.

Individual differences between study two and three are unexpected especially given that low load stuyd two is identical to working memory distractor present in study three. Identical at the single trial level however the experimental context is different. study three is just overall easier, so effects observed in study two may require some amount of general coognitive load in order to be apparent. Study one backs up this idea given that block context had significant effect on performance even when compared to identical sets of trials. Capcaity was also important from predicting performance in variable contexts, maybe the increased task difficulty in stdy two is the portion of variance being predicted by individual differences and study three is more equiaent to fixed distratcor blocks. 

# Limitations

Contralateral control, while highly advantageous for its ability to dissociate targets from distractors, and funcitonally distinct attention subprocesses, presents a range of limitations.

---------------

Binding effects? (The Role of Attention in the Maintenance of Feature Bindings in Visual Short-Term Memory) discuss this stuff. Given that my working memory task was testing binding ability. Because in change trials, the features at test were a reconfiguration of the features at encoding, there were no added or removed features. Therefore successful performance of the task required keeping bound representations in working memory, not just keeping all of the features in working memory. Maybe distraction is specifically related to binding ability. Maybe the ability to keep objects bound in working memory relies especially on processes of disengagement. Target enhancement keeps al the features present, but the combination of enhancement and suppression allows for the maintained separability of the objects.
