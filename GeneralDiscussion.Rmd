## Summary

Working memory and selective attention were historically regarded as distinct congitive constructs reflecting the operation of distinct neural processes. Research has since established not only that there is significant interaction between these two constructs, but that there appears to be significant overlap in their function and operation. The experiments reported in this thesis have useed EEG components to investigate the relationship between attention and working memory. Specifically these experiments sought to clarify the attentional mechanisms involved in the short term storage of visual information in the face of increased load and distraction. 

In \textit{Study One} we carried out a systematic analysis on the effects of distractor presence on performance in a change detection task. The change detection task is an increasingly popular paradigm for studying working memory, especially for measuring individual working memory capacity. While some uses of the change detection paradigm have previously included irrelevant objects during encoding and retrieval stages, we lacked a detailed understanding of the effect of distraction in this task. First, we showed that even when distractor number is fixed for the entire block and distractor presence is perfectly predictable, distractors presented during encoding and retrieval lead to impaired performance on the task. This effect appears to scale, to some degree, with the number of distractors in the block. Signal detection measures reveal that this is a result of decreased sensitivity to change, rather than differences in participants' response bias. Our results also demonstrated that the block context has additional effects on behavioural performance. When distractor number changed on a trial-by-trial basis such that it always matched the number of targets, performance on the easiest trials is slightly worse, and performance on the hardest trials is slightly better than equivalent trials from blocks wher distractor number was fixed.

The second aspect of \textit{Study One} involved examining the effect of individual working memory capacity on the distractor effects described above. Greater working memory capacity is related to improved performance on the task in all contexts, however there was no relationship between filtering ability and capacity in blocks where distractor number is fixed. Working memory capacity nevertheless does appear to be predictive of an individual's ability to deal with the processing constraints that are unique to blocks where distractor number is varied and unpredictable on a trial-by-trial basis. These results suggest that the relationship between working memory caacity and distraction is more limited than previously suggested and appears to be related specifically to improved ability to flexibly adapt resources in an unpredictable context. In summary, \textit{Study One} detailed the circumstances in which distractors impair working memory performance, but also confirmed two robust effects in the change detection task: first, that working memory resources are negatively impacted by increased working memory load, and second, that working memory resources are negatively impacted by distractor presence. In the subsequent experiments, we sought to specify the attentional mechanisms related to these two effects using EEG indices of attentional control.

\textit{Studies Two} and \textit{Three} made use of a set of lateralised ERP components in order to provide dissociable measures of attentional mechanisms which are difficult to tease apart using conventional approaches. The first of these is the N2pc component, defined as an increased negative voltage at posterior electrodes contralateral to an attended stimulus. Accumulating evidence suggests that the N2pc indexes the shift of visual attention onto an attended object [@dellacqua_spatial_2006;@hickey_electrophysiological_2006;@luck_spatial_1994]. N2pc amplitude has also been used as a measure of attentional capture by relevant stimuli [@kiss_attentional_2008], or pop-out objects [@eimer_attentional_2007;@holguin_n2pc_2009]. The second identified lateralized ERP component is an enhanced positivity contralateral to distracting or irrelevant objects [@hickey_electrophysiological_2009;@hilimire_competitive_2009;@toffanin_p4pc:_2011], referred to as Ptc. Findings from research by @hilimire_target_2012 suggest that the component reflects distractor suppression during the disambiguation of target features. However, evidence that Ptc can be elicited by target objects suggests that it may more generally reflect attentional disengagement from an attended stimulus [@burra_distractor_2014;@hilimire_event-related_2014;@sawaki_common_2012]. The final lateralized component relevant to attentional control during visual search is the SPCN, a sustained lateralized negativity associated with short term maintenance of task relevant features [@jolicoeur_attentional_2006;@mazza_attentional_2007;@kiss_n2pc_2008;@jolicoeur_dissociation_2008]. By recordin gthese components in the delay period of a change detection task, we hoped to elucidate which of these processes, if any, might be affected by working memory load and filtering.

In \textit{Study Two}, we used a dual task paradigm in order to manipulate working memory load while participants carried out a visual search task. In the working memory portion of the task, participants encoded either one or two of the objects displayed on screen, and then EEG was used to measure the N2pc, Ptc, and SPCN components elicited by the visual search displays but separately for targets and distractors. Our results showed that the lateralized response to distractcors was effected by increased working memory load, and specifically the distractor Ptc appeared to be attenuated. This indicates that increased working memory load impacts on an individual's ability to disengage from irrelevant distractors in the visual search dispplay. The results also showed that the lateralised neural response to objects during visual search was correlated with performance on the task. Under low load, increased laterlised positivity was correlated with faster response times on both the visual search and working memory portions of the task, while under high load increased target negativity was associated with higher visual search accuracy. Taken together, the results of \textit{Study Two} suggest that increased working memory load specifically impedes distractor disengagement, while individual differences in performance on the task are correlated with the lateralized neural response to both targets and distractors.

In \textit{Study Three}, we used a dual task paradigm in order to follow up the effect of working memory distractors on behavioural performance. Participants again performed a dual working memory a visual search task where N2pc, Ptc, and SPCN could be measured separately for targets and distractors. Throughout the experiment, participants would encode only one working memory item. Half of the time, this item was shown in the presence of an irrelevant working memory distractor, whereas the rest of the time ist was shown by itself. The behavioural evidence showed that the presence of a working memory distractor results in behavioural impairments to the concurrent visual search that are similar to those observed under increased working memory load. Lateralised ERP components reveal that target processing is modulated by the presence of the working memory distractor while distractor processing appears unaffected. The fact that N2pc was lager in the condition where behavioural performance was impaired is somewhat counterintuitive, however we also did not observe any relationships between behaviour and lateralised neural response. This suggests that larger N2pc amplitude need not be assumed to index faster, or more accurate responses. Taken together, the results of \textit{Study Three} show that working memory distractors impact negatively on visual search performance and modulate target processing, but the effect appears to be complex and specifying the mechanism involved will rely on clarifying the function of the N2pc.

## Specifying the Relationship Between Attention and Working Memory

Consensus is building in favour of the general view that there is substantial funcitonal overlap between working memory and selective attention. Previous research has attempted to specify the attentional processes that are related to working memory performance both in terms of within-subject effects of inceased working memory load, and between-subject effects of working memory capacity. Optimal performance of selective attention relies on several underlying processes including target identification and selection, proactive suppression of possible distractors, and efficient disengagement from irrelevant distractors that capture attention [@carrasco_visual_2011]. Interference with any one of these processes would affect performance on an attention-based task. While previous work has consistently shown that low working memory availabilty impairs attention, it is still unclear which specific attentional processes it affects. Some evidence has been used to suggest that working memory availability engages processes involved in attending to targets [@scalf_working_2011], while other work has claimed that working memory is related to either distractor capture [@fukuda_human_2009], or distractor disengagement [@fukuda_individual_2011]. Our results support the view that within-subject manipulations of working memory load lead to impairments of distractor disengagement, however in other respects the interaction is more complex.

Previous work has often used within-subject effects of load and between-subject differences in performance as alternate ways of measuring the same phenomenon, however our results question this approach. @heitz_focusing_2007 for example used a between-subject approach and concluded that working memory capacity affects the speed of attentional deployment to targets, whereas @de_fockert_role_2001 used a within-subject approach in order to suggest that working memory was essential for ignoring task-irrelevant distractors. The results of these two approaches are typically interpreted together and framed in terms of the effect that working memory availability has on attention [@de_fockert_beyond_2013]. Individuals with a smaller working memory capacity are said to have decreased available working memory resources and therefore the results of @heitz_focusing_2007 could be interpreted as showing that decreased availability is associated with impaired target selection. Similarly, when working memory load is increased on an individual, their available working memory is said to have decreased. The results of @de_fockert_role_2001 could then be used to suggest that decreased working memory availability is associated with impaired distractor suppression. The electrophysiological measures we used show differential effects of capacity and working memory load on attentional processes and therefore argue against the simplifying assumption that these two approaches can be combined under the umbrella term of working memory availability.

In \textit{Study Two} we used both within-subject manipulation of load and between subject correlations of performance in order to see the effects that working memory availability had on neural indices of target selection, distractor suppression, and distractor disengagement. Increased working memory load modulates the processing of distractors, and particularly the distractor Ptc which indexes the ability to disengage from distractors which have captured attention. Between-subject differences in the same task reveal that there is a relationship between performance on the working memory task and lateralized distractor negativity. These results together suggest that while increased working memory load impairs distractor disengagement, individual differences in working memory performance are related to the ability to prevent capture by salient distractors. This may explain the apparent contradictory effects described in previous research because working memory availability is associated with either distractor capture, or distractor disengagement depending whether availability is conceptualised using within-subject, or between-subject approaches.

Another distinction that we have demonstrated is that the effect of working memory distractors on attentional control seems to be different to the effects of working memory load. In \textit{Study One} we documented the effects that irrelevant objects presented within a change detection task can have on working memory performance, and the role that working memory capacity plays in addressing this distraction. A common explanation for this effect is that some individuals are worse at filtering out the irrelevant objects and therefore unnecessarily store them in working memory, reducing the availability of working memory resources [@vogel_neural_2005]. If this was the only mechanism operating then we would expect that working memory distractor presence would have similar effects on attention as increased working memory load. However, the results of \textit{Study Two} and \textit{Three} are inconsistent with this view. While manipulations of working memory load in \textit{Study One} specfically interfere with the neural processing of distractors, manipulation of working memory distractor presence in \textit{Study Three} modulates the neural processing of targets. This implies that the presence of working memory distractors doe not only impact on attention as a result of unnecessary encoding of the irrelevant stimulus, but that there are specific filtering processes engaged in the presence of working memory distractor which have a distinct effect on the subsequent operation of attention. A detailed understanding of this mechanism will require further investigation and little work has attempted to understand it so far.

While the differences between these two studies raise some interesting questions about the relationship between attention and working memory, in some respects \textit{Study Three} also acts as a useful control for \textit{Study Two}. In \textit{Study Two}, participants encoded either one or two objects before performing the concurrent visual search task. In order to balance the amount of sensory information present in the displays however, two objects were always presented on screen and a preceding cue informed the participant whether they should encode one or both of these objects. As a result, the load conditions differed not only in the amount of information that should be encoded, but also in the amount of irrelevant information presented at encoding and retrieval. In the high load condition, all of the information on screen was task relevant, whereas in the low load condition, half of the information was relevant and half irrelevant. An alternate explanation for the results in \textit{Study Two} is that the modulation of distractor related proessing is a result of this difference of irrelevant information rather than a difference of working memory load. In \textit{Study Three} however, working memory load was controlled throughout, with participants only ever encoding one object while the presence or absence of irrelevant information was manipulated. Consequently, if the presence of irrelevant information during working memory encoding and retrieval was responsible for the effects in \textit{Study Two} then we would expect the same effects of be present in \textit{Study Three}. The different results of \textit{Study Two} and \textit{Three} therefore support the assertion that the modulation of distractor disengagement processes in \textit{Study Two} was specifically related to changes in working memory load, and not working memory filtering.

The differences between \textit{Study Two} and \textit{Study Three} while informative for the reasons described above also present us with a potential problem. In \textit{Study Two}, the low load condition consisted of participants being shown two objects on screen, but being expected to encode only one of those objects. Individual differences analyses revealed that there were a number of significant relationships between lateralised neural activity and behaviour in this condition. In \textit{Study Three}, the distractor present condition also consisted of participants being shown two objects on screen and being expected to encode only one of those objects. Even though this condition is identical to the low load condition from \textit{Study Two}, in \textit{Study Three} we observed no significant relationships between lateralised neural activity and behaviour. This may indicate that the individual differences observed in \textit{Study Two} were suprious or that the analyses in \textit{Study Three} were underpowered. However, another possible explanation for this relates to the context effects we observed in \textit{Study One}.

In \textit{Study One}, our analyses showed that working memory accuracy and participants' sensitivity to changes in the change detection task were affected by the context of the block. The general effect appeared to show that in a variable distracotr block where distractor number was unpredictable from trial to trial, performance on all trials became closer to the block average when compared to the exact same trial types taken from blocks where distractor number was fixed. This provides a plausible explanation for why identical trial types in \textit{Study Two} and \textit{Three} may result in different behavioural dynamics. It may be the case that in \textit{Study Two} when average cognitive load was higher, individuals processed the low load trials differently than in \textit{Study Three} when cognitive load was lower. As a result, the relationships observed between behaviour and lateralised neural activity may only be detectable under conditions of high cognitive load when the system is under stress. Under low cognitive load participants could be more or less operating at ceiling whereas under higher cognitive load, small differences in target selection, and distractor disengagement abilities may become critical factors for determining task performance.

## Limitations

There are several limitations to the experimental designs used in this experiment. \textit{Study One} used a fairly standard change detection paradigm and therefore suffers from the general limitations of that approach. Namely, that capacity estimates in the change detection paradigm assume that working memory consists of a set of discrete slots which each hold a single chunk of bound information [@rouder_how_2011], however this claim is still contentious [@luck_visual_2013]. Change detetion cpapacity estimates also depend on set size matching or exceeding individual capacity, which makes group averages problematic, and they do not account for participant error resulting from, for example, temporary lapses of attention [@rouder_how_2011]. In our case however part of the motivation for carrying out \textit{Study One} was to quantify the effect that irrelevant objects have on capacity estimates used in this specific task and therefore altering the task to accommodate these issues would have undermined the generalisability of our results to the intended literature. A smaller issue which should be resolved in future iterations of this design would be to include zero distractor trials in the variable distractor block types. This would allow us to measure filtering cost for variable distractor blocks in the same way we did for fixed distractor blocks, and answer the question of whether block context alters this measure.

\textit{Studies Two} and \textit{Three} used a very similar paradigm which had its own set of limitations. For one, the working memory portion of the task used coloured shapes as the objects to be stored and retrieved. It is possible that there is significant heterogeneity in terms of the way in which participants store these kinds of objects, and that their different strategies effect the subsequent interference of visual search. The intention was for participants to store the objects as visual representations under the assumption that this would maximise the amount of interference imposed on the visual search task. It is possible however that some participants stored the names of the shapes and colours and therefore used a phonological storage mechanism. There are substantial theoretical, and empirical differences in the way that visual and verbal information are stored both in terms of the storage operations and anatomical networks involved [@crottaz-herbette_modality_2004;@baddeley_working_2003]. In our data there is no way to know which strategy each participant used and therefore no way to quantify the effect that these strategy differences would have. However, this issue does not reresent a critical problem given that we managed to demonstrate the desired behavioural interaction between attention and working memory. Future research could consider using more abstract visual objects (to limit phonological storage), or words (to limit visual storage) in order to tease apart this effect and see whether or not it can be accounted for by one or both of these strategies.

While our paradigms were primarily created with within-subject comparisons in mind, they demonstrated the potential utility of these lateralised components in specifying the attentional mechanisms underlying individual differences in working memory capacity. In our case however, working memory performance was measured using the working memory portion of the dual task from which our ERP components were measured. Previous work has suggested that the apparent relationship between capacity and distractibility may be a result of the fact that measures of filtering are often calculated from performance in the same task that is used to measure working memory capacity [@fukuda_human_2009;@fukuda_individual_2011;@unsworth_influence_2016]. @mall_visual_2014 challenged the relationship between working memory capacity and distractibility by showing that when working memory capacity is measured form an independent task, individuals with low capacity are less likely to fixate on irrelevant objects, and less likely to recall objects which had been identified as irrelevant. @robison_individual_2018 used independent measures of working memory capacity in order to show that while increased working memory capacity predicts better filtering in some circumstances, the relatinoship is more constrained than previously suggested. The fact that working memory performance and ERP component amplitude were both measured from the same task in \textit{Studies Two} and \textit{Three} may similarly have resulted in over-estimation of the relationship between working memory performance and distractor capture that we identified.

There are also limitations to the visual search task used to measure the lateralised ERP components in \textit{Studies Two} and \textit{Three}. An inherent limitation of the use of the contralateral control method to separate target and distractor processing is that it involes only one object being presented on the horizontal midline, while the other is lateralised. In order to maximise trial numbers that typically means that the target is on the midline half of the time, and the distractor is on the midline half of the time. While there are sixteen possible locations in the target-deocy task we used, only two of these are midline locations which means that targets do not randomy appear in any of the sixteen locations across the experiment; rather, they appear in two of the locations 50% of the time and in one of the other fourteen locations 50% of the time. It is possible that this significantly changes a participant's approach to the visual search task and that rather than searching the entire dispaly, they focus their attention on the midline of the displays and only search elsewhere when the midline object is determined to be a target. This changes the dynamics of the visual search task, potentially improving average performance given that the target location is partially predictable. However, it is not clear that it changes the task in a way that undermines our conclusions. This could be solved by including trials where both objects are lateralized, although this would result in either a large increase in the total number of trials and therefore increased participant fatigue, or a reduction in the number of trials that can be used to isolate the ERP components of interest and therefore reduced signal-to-noise ratio. 

## Future Directions

The results of \textit{Study Three} raised a possible future direction for working memory research. One of the speculative explanations for our finding that N2pc was attenuated in the condition where behaviour was improved is related to potential competition between working memory representations and the external world. To our knowledge, while there is ample evidence of competition between two externally presented stimuli, and a separate line of evidence for the representation of visual working memory in primary visual areas, there is no direct evidence looking at the implication that objects stored in working memory may therefore compete with external stimuli for representation in V1. To this end, we are currently collecting data for a study which investigates the possibility of this competition, and the effect that it could have on the laterlised components used in this thesis. Our task presents participants with a set of six visual search displays similar to those used in \textit{Studies Two} and \textit{Three}, where they are required to locate and store the target object on each display. By manipulating whether these targets are presented within or across the horizontal midline we can manipulate whether or not they are represented by  neurons in the same hemisphere or across hemispheres. If these objects compete for representation in the  same way as externally presented stimuli then we would expect to see an attenuated N2pc to targets in the within hemisphere condition.

The conclusions of the studies presented in this thesis also indicate several broad lines of inquiry that future research should pursue. One such area would be clarification of the cognitive processes indexed by each of the lateralised components. The conclusions in this thesis rely substantially on the use of the N2pc, Ptc, and SPCN elicited by targets and distractors in order to dissociate cognitive processes that are otherwise difficult to tease apart. At the outset of these studies we relied on prevailing views in the literature that N2pc reflects orienting of attention to a potential targets, Ptc reflects subsequent suppression of a distractor which has captured attention, and SPCN reflects short-term storage of target features. While these are the most common conceptions of N2pc, Ptc, and SPCN, the functional role of each of these components is still contentious and in some cases our data better fit with alternate interpretations. This was best demonstrated in \textit{Study Three} where we concluded that working memory filtering impacts on early stages of target processing however we could not confidently explain the direction of the effects we observed. Using the prevailing view of N2pc as an index of attentional orienting, it was difficult to explain how working memory filtering led to impaired orienting but enhanced behavioural performance. An alternate account, that N2pc indexes the pre-attentive flagging of potential target locations potentially explains previous N2pc data, and also fits better with our results. Future research should focus on specifying the role of N2pc which would allow specification of the effect of working memory filtering in \textit{Study Three}.

There are similar contentions regarding the processes indexed by Ptc and SPCN, further limiting the conclusions we could draw from \textit{Studies Two} and \textit{Three}. Ptc for example was initially speculated to reflect a biasing signal which resolves competitive interactions between visual stimuli [@hilimire_competitive_2009;@hilimire_event-related_2010], but has since been suggested to reflect distactor suppression, and stimulus disengagement [@hilimire_dynamics_2011;@hilimire_event-related_2014;@hilimire_target_2012]. Similar questions surround the function of SPCN which has typically been associated with short-term storage as a result of its sensitivity to the number of stored objects. A recent study proposed instead however that SPCN may reflect activation of working memory representations that are presently in the focus of attention. Given the demonstated utility of these components in understanding the relationship between working memory and attention, Resolving these questions around the functions of N2pc, Ptc, and SPCN is critical for increasing the specificity of our understanding of this relationship.

Another area of research which may provide utility in understanding working memory and selective attenion is steady state evoked potentials (SSEP). The studies preseented in this thesis rely on the use of lateralised components to provide dissociable measures of attentional processes that are otherwise difficult to measure. One of the main advantages of this approach is that targets and distractors are displayed simultaneously, but the processing of each stimulus can still be isolated. This allows us to measure the processing of a target in the presence of distraction, while removing neural activity associated with distractors. Given the limitations of this technique that were mentioned above, an alternate possibility for isolating neural measures of targets and distractors in mixed displays is the SSEP technique. SSEPs are elicited when stimuli are flickered at a fixed frequency, causing entrainment of that frequency in recorded EEG activity. SSEPs are increasingly common as a method for studying attention and may be able to provide distinct measures of target and distractor processing that inform our understanding of attention's relationship with working memory. 

There is a fairly large set of attention research based on SSEP designs because of their high signal-to-noise ratio and ability to distinguish neural processesing of each stimulus in a multi-object display. Initial application of SSEPs to attention was performed by @morgan_selective_1996 when they showed participants two sets of stimuli, each on a box which flickered at a different frequency. When participants were required to attend to one of these sets of stimuli, neural activity at the flicker frequency was increased relative to the unattended frequency. This effect has been used to study the spatial distribution of attention by tagging locations with different frequencies [@muller_can_2002;@muller_sustained_2003;@malinowski_sustained_2007], as well as the dynamics of feature based attention by tagging visual features with different frequencies [@malinowski_sustained_2007;@pei_neural_2002]. Importantly in our case, SSEPs have been used to show that attention both facilitates the processing of target colours while also actively inhibiting distractor colours. If SSEP designs can be used to measure distinct target selection and distractor suppression mechanisms then they may be able to provide similar utility as lateralized ERPs while avoiding the low signal-to-noise ratio and location-based constraints of our contralateral control design.

## General Conclusion

A detailed understanding of the relationship between working memory and selective attention is currently lacking in the psychology literature. Working memory capacity and working memory load are important features of the working memory system which have been demonstrated to have some association with attentional control. The studies described in this thesis examine the interaction between working memory and attention using change detection paradigms and lateralised ERP components. They reveal that while working memory capacity is associated with neural indices of distractor capture, its relationship to distractibility is limited to contexts in which distractor number is unpredictable. Working memory load modulates neural responses to distractor processing but seems to be specifically related to distractor disengagement. OUr results also showed that the inclusion of irrelevant objects during working memory encoding and retrieval has a significant impact on both wokring memory performance and performance on a concurrent visual search task. Laterlised ERP components reveal that these irrelevant objects modulate processes of target selection. More broadly, this set of results demonstrates the utility of lateralised ERPs in providing dissocialbe measures of specific attentional subprocesses, and therefore provides a promising tool for future research which investigates the relationship between working memory and selective attention.
