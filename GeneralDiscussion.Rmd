# Summary

Working memory and selective attention were historically regarded as distinct congitive constructs reflecting the operation of distinct neural processes. Research has since established not only that there is significant interaction between these two constructs, but that there appears to be significant overlap in their function and operation. The experiments reported in this thesis have useed EEG components to investigate the relationship between attention and working memory. Specifically these experiments sought to clarify the attentional mechanisms involved in the short term storage of visual information in the face of increased load and distraction. 

In \textit{Study One} we carried out a systematic analysis on the effects of distractor presence on performance in a change detection task. The change detection task is an increasingly popular paradigm for studying working memory, and measuring individual working memory capacity. While some uses of the change detection paradigm have included irrelevant objects during encoding and retrieval stages, we lacked a detailed understanding of the effect of distraction in this task. First, we showed that even when distractor number is fixed for the entire block and distractor presence is perfectly predictable, distractors presented during encoding and retrieval lead to impaired performance on the task. This effect appears to scale, to some degree, with the number of distractors in the block. Signal detection measures reveal that this is a result of decreased sensitivity to change, rather than a differences in participants' response bias. Our results also demonstrated that the block context has additional effects on behavioural performance. When distractor number changed on a trial-by-trial basis such that it always matched the number of targets, performance on the easiest trials gets slightly worse, and performance on the hardest trials gets slightly better than equivalent trials from blocks wher distractor number was fixed.

The second aspect of \textit{Study One} involved examining the effect of individual working memory capacity on the distractor effects described above. Working memory capacity is related to improved performance on the task in all contexts however there was no relationship between filtering ability and capacity in blocks where distractor number is fixed. Working memory capacity however does appear to be predictive of an individual's ability to deal with the processing constraints that are unique to blocks where distractor number is varied and unpredictable on a trial-by-trial basis. These results suggest that the relationship between working memory caacity and distraction is more limited than previously suggested and appears to be related specifically to improved ability to flexibly adapt resources in an unpredictable context. In summary, \textit{Study One} detailed the circumstances in which distractors impair working memory performance, but also confirmed two robust effects in the change detection task. First that working memory resources are negatively impacted by increased working memory load, and secondly, that working memory resources are negatively impacted by distractor presence. In the subsequent experiments, we sought to specify the attentional mechanisms related to these two effects using EEG indices of attentional control.

\textit{Studies Two} and \textit{Three} made use of a set of lateralised ERP components in order to provide dissociable measures of attentional mechanisms which are difficult to tease apart using conventional approaches. The first of these is the N2pc component, defined as an increased negative voltage at posterior electrodes contralateral to an attended stimulus. Accumulating evidence suggests that the N2pc indexes the shift of visual attention onto an attended object [@dellacqua_spatial_2006;@hickey_electrophysiological_2006;@luck_spatial_1994]. N2pc amplitude has also been used as a measure of attentional capture by relevant stimuli [@kiss_attentional_2008], or pop-out objects [@eimer_attentional_2007;@holguin_n2pc_2009]. The second identified lateralized ERP component is an enhanced positivity contralateral to distracting or irrelevant objects [@hickey_electrophysiological_2009;@hilimire_competitive_2009;@toffanin_p4pc:_2011], referred to as Ptc. Findings from research by @hilimire_target_2012 suggest that the component reflects distractor suppression during the disambiguation of target features. However, evidence that Ptc can be elicited by target objects suggests that it may more generally reflect attentional disengagement from an attended stimulus [@burra_distractor_2014;@hilimire_event-related_2014;@sawaki_common_2012]. The final lateralized component relevant to attentional control during visual search is a sustained lateralized negativity associated with short term maintenance of task relevant features [@jolicoeur_attentional_2006;@mazza_attentional_2007;@kiss_n2pc_2008;@jolicoeur_dissociation_2008]. By recordin gthese components in the delay period of a change detection task, we hoped to elucidate which of these processes, if any, might be effected by working memory load and filtering.

In \textit{Study Two}, we used a dual task paradigm in order to manipulate working memory load while participants carried out a visual search task. Participants encoded either one or two of the objects displayed on screen, and EEG was used to measure the N2pc, Ptc, and SPCN components elicited by the visual search displays. Our results showed that the lateralized response to distractcors was effected by increased working memory load, and specifically the distractor Ptc appeared to be attenuated. This indicates that increased working memory load impacts on an individual's ability to disengage from irrelevant distractors in the visual search dispplay. The results also showed that the lateralised neural response to objects during visual search was correlated with performance on the task. Under low load, increased laterlised positivity was correlated with faster response times on both the visual search and working memory portions of the task, while under high load increased target negativity was associated with higher visual search accuracy. Taken together, the results of \textit{Study Two} suggest that increased working memory load specifically impedes distractor disengagement, while individual differences in performance on the task are correlated with improved target selection, reduced distractor capture, and more efficient object disengagement.

In \textit{Study Three}, we used a dual task paradigm in order to follow up the effect of working memory distractors on behavioural performance. Participants again performed a dual working memory a selective attention task where N2pc, Ptc, and SPCN could be measured separately for targets and distractors. Throughout the task, participants would encode only one working memory item, but half of the time this item was shown in the presence of a working memory distractor. The behavioural evidence showed that the presence of a working memory distractor results in behavioural impairments to the concurrent visual search that are similar to those observed under increased working memory load. Lateralised ERP components reveal that target processing is modulated by the presence of the working memory distractor while distractor processing appears unaffected. The fact that N2pc was lager in the condition where behavioural performance was impaired is somewhat sounterintuitive, however we also did not observe any relationships between behaviour and lateralised neural response suggesting that larger N2pc amplitude need not be assumed to index better performance. Taken together, the results of \textit{Study Three} show that working memory distractors impact negatively on visual search performance and modulate target processing, however the effect appears to be complex and specifying the mechanism involved will rely on clarifying the function of the N2pc.

# Specifying the relationship between attention and working memory

Consensus is building in favour of the general view that there is substantial funcitonal overlap between working memory and selective attention. Research is now attempting to specify the attentional processes that are related to working memory performance both in terms of within-subject effects of inceased working memory load, and between-subject effects of working memory capacity. Optimal performance of selective attention relies on several underlying processes including target identification and selection, proactive suppression of possible distractors, and efficient disengagement from irrelevant distractors that capture attention [@carrasco_visual_2011]. Evidence for the effects of low working memory availability on attentional interference is equivocal, and interference with any one of these processes would produce impaired behavioral performance associated with low working memory availability. Some evidence has been used to suggest that working memory availability engages processes involved in attending to targets, while other work has claimed that working memory is relate dto either distractor capture, or distractor disengagement. Our results suport the view that within-subject manipulations of working memory load lead to impairments of distractor disengagement, however in other respects the interaction is more complex.

Previous work has often used within-subject effects of load, and between-subject differences in performance as alternate ways of measuring the same phenomenon however our results question this approach. @heitz_focusing_2007 for example used a between-subject approach and concluded that working memory capacity affects the speed of attentional deployment to targets, whereas @de_fockert_role_2001 used a within-subject approach in order to suggest that working memory was essential for ignoring task-irrelevant distractors. The results of these two approaches are typically interpreted together and framed in terms of the effect that working memory availability has on attention [@de_fockert_beyond_2013]. Individuals with a smaller working memory capacity are said to have decreased available working memory resources and therefore the results of @heitz_focusing_2007 could be interpreted as showing that decreased availability is associated with impaired target selection. Similarly, when working memory load is increased on an individual, their available working memory is said to have decreased. The results of @de_fockert_role_2001 could then be used to suggest that decreased working memory availability is associated with impaired distractor suppression. The electrophysiological measures we used show differential effects of capacity and working memory load on attentional processes and therefore argue against the simplifying assumption that these two approaches can be combined under the umbrella of working memory availability.

In \textit{Study Two} we used both within-subject manipulation of load and between subject correlations of performance in order to see the effects that working memory availability had on neural indices of target selection, distractor suppression, and distractor disengagement. Increased working memory load modulates the processing of distractors, and particularly the distractor Ptc which indexes the ability to disengage from distractors which have captured attention. Between-subject differences in the same task reveal that there is a relationship between performance on the working memory task and the negative amplitude elicited by lateralised distractors. These results together suggest that while increased working memory load impairs distractor disengagement, individual differences in working memory performance are related to the ability to prevent capture by salient distractors. This may explain the apparent contradictory effects described in previous research because working memory availability is associated with either distractor capture, or distractor disengagement depending whether availability is conceptualised using within-subject, or between-subject approaches.

Another distinction that we have demonstrated is that the effect of working memory distractors on attentional control seems to be different to the effects of working memory load. In \textit{Study One} we documented the effects that irrelevant objects presented within a change detection task can have on working memory performance, and the role that working memory capacity plays in addressing this distraction. A common explanation for this effect is that some individuals are worse at filtering out the irrelevant objects and therefore unnecessarily store them in working memory, reducing the availability of working memory resources [@vogel_neural_2005]. If this was the only mechanism operating then we would expect that working memory distractor presence would have similar effects on attention as increased working memory load however the results of \textit{Study Two} and \textit{Three} are inconsistent with this view. While manipulations of working memory load in \textit{Study One} specfically interfere with the neural processing of distractors, manipulation of working memory distractor presence modulates the neural processing of targets. This implies that the presence of working memory distractors doe not only impact on attention as a result of unnecessary encoding of the irrelevant stimulus, but that there are specific filtering processes engaged in the presence of working memory distractor which have a distinct effect on the subsequent operation of attention. A detailed understanding of this mechanism will require further investigation and little work has attempted to understand it so far.

While the differences between these two studies raise some interesting questions about the relationship between attention and working memory, in some respects \textit{Study Three} also acts as a useful control for \textit{Study Two}. In \textit{Study Two}, participants encoded either one or two objects before performing the concurrent visual search task. In order to balance the amount of sensory information present in the displays however, two objects were always presented on screen and a preceding cue informed the participant whether they should encode one or both of these objects. As a result, the load conditions differed not only in the amount of information that should be encoded, but also in the amount of irrelevant information presented at encoding and retrieval. In the high load condition, all of the information on screen was task relevant, whereas in the low load condition, half of the information was relevant and half irrelevant. An alternate explanation for the results in \textit{Study Two} is that the modulation of distractor related proessing is a result of this difference of irrelevant information rather than a difference of working memory load. In \textit{Study Three} however, working memory load was controlled throughout, with participants only ever encoding one object while the presence or absence of irrelevant information was manipulated. Consequently, if the presence of irrelevant information during working memory encoding and retrieval was responsible for the effects in \textit{Study Two} then we would expect the same effects of be present in \textit{Study Three}. The different results of \textit{Study Two} and \textit{Three} therefore support the assertion that the modulation of distractor disengagement processes in \textit{Study Two} was specifically related to changes in working memory load, and not working memory filtering.

The differences between \textit{Study Two} and \textit{Study Three} while informative for the reasons described above also present us with a potential problem. In \textit{Study Two}, the low load condition consisted of participants being shown two objects on screen, but being expected to encode only one of those objects. Individual differences analyses revealed that there were a number of significant relationships between lateralised neural activity and behaviour in this condition. In \textit{Study Three}, the distractor present condition also consisted of participants being shown two objects on screen and being expected to encode only one of those objects. Even though this condition is identical to the low load condition from \textit{Study Two}, in \textit{Study Three} we observed no significant relationships between lateralised neural activity and behaviour. This may indicate that the individual differences observed in \textit{Study Two} were suprious or that the analyses in \textit{Study Three} were underpowered, however another possible explanation for this relates to the context effects we observed in \textit{Study One}.

In \textit{Study One}, our analyses showed that working memory accuracy and participants' sensitivity to changes in the change detection task were affected by the context of the block. The general effect appeared to show that in a variable distracotr block where distractor number was unpredictable from trial to trial, performance on all trials became closer to the block average when compared to the exact same trial types taken from blocks where distractor number was fixed. This provides a plausible explanation for why identical trial types in \textit{Study Two} and \textit{Three} may result in different behavioural dynamics. It may be the case that in \textit{Study Two} when average cognitive load was higher, individuals processed the low load trials differently than in \textit{Study Three} when cognitive load was lower. As a result, the relationships observed between behaviour and lateralised neural activity may only detectable under conditions of high cognitive load when the system is under stress. Under low cognitive load participants could be more or less operating at ceiling whereas under cognitive load, small differences in target selection, and distractor disengagement abilities may become critical factors for determining task performance.

# Limitations

There are several limitations to the experimental designs used in this experiment. \textit{Study One} used a fairly standard change detection paradigm and therefore suffers from the general limitations of that approach. Namely, that capacity estimates in the change detection paradigm assume that working memory consists of a set of discrete slots which each hold a single chunk of bound information [@rouder_how_2011], however this claim is still contentious `r #Visual working memory capacity: from psychophysics and neurobiology to individual differences Author links open overlay panelSteven J.Luck1Edward K.Vogel2`. Change detetion cpapacity estimates also depend on set size matching or exceeding individual capacity, which makes group averages problematic, and they do not account for participant error resulting frrmo thigns like temporary lapses of attention [@rouder_how_2011]. In our case however part of the motivation for carrying out \textit{Study One} was to quantify the effect that irrelevant objects have on capacity estimates used in this specific task and therefore altering the task to accommodate these issues would have undermined the generalisability of our results to the intended literature. A smaller issue which should be resolved in future iterations of this design would be to include zero distractor trials in the variable distractor block types. This would allow us to measure filtering cost for variable distractor blocks in the same way we did for fixed distractor blocks, and answer the question of whether lock context alters this measure.

\textit{Studies Two} and \textit{Three} used a very similar paradigm which had its own set of limitations. For one, the working memory portion of the task used coloured shapes as the objects to be stored and retrieved. It is possible that there is significant heterogeneity in terms of the way in which participants store these kinds of objects, and that their different strategies effect the subsequent interference of visual search. The intention was for participants to store the objects as visual representations under the assumption that this would maximise the amount of interference imposed on the visual search task. It is possible however that some participants stored the names of the shapes and colours and therefore used a phonological storage mechanism. There are substantial theoretical, and empirical differences in the way that visual and verbal information are stored both in terms of the storage operations and anatomical networks involved `r #reference`. In our data there is no way to know which strategy each participant used and therefore no way to quantify the effect that these strategy differences would have, however this issue does not reresent a critical given that we managed to demonstrate the desired behavioural interaction between attention and working memory. Future research could consider using more abstract visual objects (to limit phonological storage), or words (to limit visual storage) in order to tease apart this effect and see whether one or both of these strategies underlies our effects.

While our paradigms were primarily created with within-subject comparisons in mind, they demonstrated the potential utility of these lateralised components in specifying the attentional mechanisms underlying individual differences in working memory capacity. In our case however, working memory performance was measured using the working memory portion of the dual task from which our ERP components were measured. Previous work has suggested that the apparent relationship between capacity and distractibility may be a result of the fact that measures of filtering are often calculated from performance in the same task that is used to measure working memory capacity [@fukuda_human_2009;@fukuda_individual_2011;@unsworth_influence_2016]. @mall_visual_2014 challenged the relationship between working memory capacity and distractibility by showing that when working memory capacity is measured form an independent task, individuals with low capacity are less likely to fixate on irrelevant objects, and less likely to recall objects which had been identified as irrelevant. @robison_individual_2018 used independent measures of working memory capacity in order to show that while increased working memory capacity predicts better filterin gin some circumstances, the relatinoship is more constrained than previously suggested. The fact that working memory performance and ERP component amplitude were both measured from the same task in \textit{Studies Two} and \textit{Three} may similarly have resulted in over-estimation of the relationship between working memory performance and distractor capture that we identified.

There are also limitations to the visual search task used to measure the lateralised ERP components in \textit{Studies Two} and \textit{Three}. 

Contralateral control, while highly advantageous for its ability to dissociate targets from distractors, and funcitonally distinct attention subprocesses, presents a range of limitations.

Binding effects? (The Role of Attention in the Maintenance of Feature Bindings in Visual Short-Term Memory) discuss this stuff. Given that my working memory task was testing binding ability. Because in change trials, the features at test were a reconfiguration of the features at encoding, there were no added or removed features. Therefore successful performance of the task required keeping bound representations in working memory, not just keeping all of the features in working memory. Maybe distraction is specifically related to binding ability. Maybe the ability to keep objects bound in working memory relies especially on processes of disengagement. Target enhancement keeps al the features present, but the combination of enhancement and suppression allows for the maintained separability of the objects.
